So, I've just started reading [Bullshit Jobs: A Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs) by the late [David Graeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Graeber). I'd say it's quite the thought-triggering book (wether you agree with it or not), so obviously I have some.

I had already heard about this theory of Graeber's, especially when his first article came out, but I was still a student at the time. And coming back to those ideas and finally being able to confront them with my own experience has given them more substance.

## What's a bullshit job, exactly?

Some quick catching-up if you haven't read the book or don't quite remember: Graeber defines a *bullshit job* as "a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case".

As soon as I read that definition I wanted to nitpick it, but Graeber does a pretty good job of deflecting the most obvious criticisms and adding enough precisions. What I didn't quite get, however, was wether he was talking about jobs as positions or jobs as entire professions.

Now this might be because I'm not a native english speaker, or maybe it's just because I couldn't be bothered to read the whole thing before giving my opinion (oups), but I feel that both are the subject of the book? So obviously, since I'm just here for opinion-giving purposes, I'll try and get into both aspects.

## Is my job, as in 'my current position', a bullshit job?

So right now, I'm working in a medium-sized IT consulting firm, on a project tied to the french electricity network (technically a private company, but publicly-owned). It's quite a big project, even though a significant part of it is "just" modernizing different old internal applications and kind of merging everything into one big thing.

However, organizational constraints and shitty architecture decisions and the fact that we're never quite sure what we're supposed to be coding exactly has made this job... *not great*. It feels like most of my time is spent either reviewing code (which is a normal thing to do, just not this much) or fixing it. I don't think I've worked on a new feature in months, and we're not even in production yet (what a ride that will be)!

So is it bullshit? Is it just "duct taping" and "completely pointless"?

Well if I'm only thinking about myself, I'd much rather be there and care for the code we're shipping instead of having the same project but without someone who genuinely cares.  
On the other hand, if it's more like "we could do things better and not need a third of our team to be constantly fixing broken things", then... yes? But also, would that be a case of Bullshit Job or just another case of Bullshit Management?[^management]

Anyway, I guess my current job is kind of bullshit and I'm happy that I don't let my job define me.

## Is my job, as in 'IT in general' a bullshit job?

Well, I mean, you've heard about (generative) AI, right? The Metaverse? Crypto-currency? Non-stop data collection? Popup-ads? Auto-playing videos? Yup, that's all us [^us]. It's somewhat impressive that a profession could be so annoying yet so ubiquitous, and I wouldn't blame you if you thought IT to be a bullshit magnet (it kind of is, sadly).  

[^management]: Not everything is decided by management (not the technical parts at least), but trading quality for quantity is always their call.

[^us]: Doesn't mean we're always responsible for what we're working on, but you get the point.
