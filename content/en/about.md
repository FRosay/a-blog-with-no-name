If you're wondering who's behind this mess of a website[^mess], well you've just about clicked the right link. But let's make this short, shall we?

So: I'm a 30 something french web developer (officially *full-stack*, urgh) who actually made a career change after graduating from a Faculty of Law[^joke], of all things.

The list of what I love or like would be way too long, but includes my wife, my cat, role-playing games or Becky Chambers' books (yes, **all of them**).

That's it. I might revisit this one day, but until then it'll have to do!  

[^mess]: It may not look like a mess from the outside, but believe me: it is.
[^joke]: I mean, before I cut it I *was* the only guy with long hair back then, so I could have seen it coming.
