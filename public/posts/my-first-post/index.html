    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Welcome, welcome! Out of the more than 1.1 billion existing websites, you chose to spend your precious time on this shoddy little part of the Web. It makes me feel honoured, proud, but honestly also a bit worried too. I hope you’ll like it here: although there’s not much at the moment, I truly plan on making this place as cosy and welcoming as a digital blog - or garden, as is the trend - can be.</p>
<p>I know nothing about blogs, blogging or being a blogger, at least nothing more than expected from a digital native. I’ve also barely ever posted on social media and have a few (dozen) projects already taking up my mental (and sometimes physical) space, but here I am adding one more to the pile - and this time it’s even public! So… why? Why am I doing this and pretending that you should too?</p>
<p>Well, since you’re curious - don’t be shy, I know you are! -, let me just list some of the reasons why I, at least, started a blog:</p>
<h2 id="1-its-fun">1: It’s fun!</h2>
<p>Have you ever wanted to randomly ramble for hours on end about subjects so specific that no-one around you even pretends to care? Or if you’re not prone to rambles, how about rants? Surely you must rant on a regular basis, like I can only assume most people do? Well then it just gets better to let it all out, screaming into the void, so to say.</p>
<p>I mean, just imagine what you could be writing: absolutely anything you want. No-one can stop you. No-one can even know it’s you. Now go write that 100.000-words essay about your unabated love for your cat!</p>
<h2 id="2-its-free-digital-real-estate">2: It’s free (digital) real estate!</h2>
<p>There are so many free and easy ways to get your blog up and running these days that the most difficult part is actually choosing the one you’re going to use.</p>
<p>While this particular ego-trip of mine is built with Hugo and hosted on [HOST_UNDEFINED], you truly have an absurd amount of choices. It ranges from small non-profits offering open-source hosting solutions to literally the biggest companies on Earth: pick your poison!</p>
<h2 id="3-its-a-nice-way-to-give-your-impostor-syndrome-the-finger">3: It’s a nice way to give your impostor syndrome the finger</h2>
<p>“No-one cares about what I’m thinking anyway” can become “No-one cares, but I don’t either!”. Or “I’ve nothing interesting enough to tell the world” can turn into that essay about your cat. Seriously, think about it</p>
